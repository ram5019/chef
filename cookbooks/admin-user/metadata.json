{"name":"admin-user","description":"Sets up a shared admin user to manage the system","long_description":"Description [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/admin-user.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/admin-user)\n===========\nThis cookbook is used to set up a single shared admin user on a host, and then set\nup a list of SSH keys to log in to it.\n\n> NOTE This cookbook does not use search, it simply looks at the contents of a specific data bag\n\n\nCompatibility\n=============\nTested on:\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04\n* Ubuntu 12.04\n* CentOS 6.3\n* CentOS 5.8\n\nwith Chef versions `10.18` and `11.04`.\nAssumed to work with other Debian and RedHat based distros as well.\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n    ['admin-user']['user'] = The admin user to create (defaults to \"admin\")\n    ['admin-user']['group'] = The primary group for the admin user (defaults to \"admin\")\n    ['admin-user']['data_bag'] = The data bag to load the SSH keys from (defaults to \"users\")\n    ['admin-user']['authorized_keys'] = List of key names that will be enabled on the host (defaults to all)\n\n\nUsage\n=====\nWith the default settings, this cookbook assumes that you have a data bag called \"users\",\nwith a data bag item called \"admin\" - the name of the data bag item we look for is the\nsame at the user defined in `['admin-user']['user']`. The data bag item should look\nsomething like this:\n\n    {\n        \"id\" : \"admin\",\n        \"authorized_keys\" : {\n            \"jack\" : \"ssh key for jack goes here\",\n            \"jill\" : \"ssh key for jill goes here\"\n        }\n    }\n\nBy default, the keys listed under \"authorized_keys\" will all be added for the \"admin\" user.\n\n### Restricting keys\nIf you only want to allow a subset of users to have access, you can change `['admin-user']['authorized_keys']` to\nan array with a list of key names. For the example above, you could set it to `[\"jack\"]` to only copy the SSH\nkey for \"jack\", and not \"jill\".\n\n\nDevelopment\n============\nPlease refer to the Readme [here](https://github.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/cookbook-development/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Adam Borocz ([on GitHub](https://github.com/motns))\n\nCopyright:: 2013, HipSnip Ltd.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n","maintainer":"HipSnip Ltd.","maintainer_email":"adam@hipsnip.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 10.04","centos":">= 5.8"},"dependencies":{"sudo":">= 2.2.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{"admin-user/user":{"display_name":"User","description":"The admin user to create","type":"string","default":"admin","choice":[],"calculated":false,"required":"optional","recipes":[]},"admin-user/group":{"display_name":"Group","description":"The primary group for the admin user","type":"string","default":"admin","choice":[],"calculated":false,"required":"optional","recipes":[]},"admin-user/data_bag":{"display_name":"Data Bag","description":"The data bag to load the SSH keys from","type":"string","default":"users","choice":[],"calculated":false,"required":"optional","recipes":[]},"admin-user/authorized_keys":{"display_name":"Authorized Keys","description":"List of key names that will be enabled on the host","choice":[],"calculated":false,"type":"string","required":"optional","recipes":[]}},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"1.1.2"}
